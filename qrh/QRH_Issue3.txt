GENERAL
This section contains the procedures that should be performed in the event of
an emergency or malfunction. The procedures used for each actual
emergency or malfunction must result from consideration of the overall
situation. Multiple emergencies or malfunctions may require a departure from
normal corrective procedures detailed in this section and is at the discretion of
the pilot.
The emergencies and malfunctions procedures are presented either as a
procedural list of actions or in the form of flow charts.
The flow charts are based on cockpit indications that would be available to the
pilot, a brief description of the emergency / malfunction, and the subsequent
actions required by the pilot.
For some types of emergency / malfunction the flow charts give the pilot
differing procedures depending on certain criteria. The correct procedure to
follow can be defined by the flight condition, such as ‘On ground’ or ‘In flight’,
by a Yes/No answer to certain questions, such as ‘Does smoke clear?’, or by
‘IF’ statements to identify more precisely the exact condition encountered
which will dictate the correct procedure to follow on the flow chart.
The necessary pilot actions in the procedures commence with a dash ‘-’ and
are typed in bold text to make them more conspicuous.
Emergency Procedures are concerned with foreseeable but unusual
situations in which immediate and precise crew actions, as indicated by the
actions in bold and boxed, will substantially reduce the risk to the helicopter
and personnel.
USE OF WARNINGS, CAUTIONS AND NOTES
Warnings, Cautions and Notes are used to emphasize important and critical
instructions and are used as follows:
WARNING
An operating procedure, practice, etc., which, if not correctly
followed, could result in personal injury or loss of life.
CAUTION
An operating procedure, practice, etc., which, if not strictly
observed, could result in damage to, or destruction of,
equipment.
Note
An operating procedure, condition, etc., which is essential to
highlight.

SAFE OEI FLIGHT
WARNING
In general safe OEI flight is defined to mean (1) a sustainable airspeed of not
MSGS
less than 50 KIAS, (2) the ability to obtain a positive rate of climb at acceptable
power levels and (3) an altitude which provides sufficient clearance from the
ground/obstacles so that required manoeuvring can be reasonably achieved.
At crew discretion, other procedural checks/actions may be carried out while
these conditions are being established.
EMERGENCY LANDING GUIDANCE
Throughout this Section, three terms are used to indicate the degree of
urgency with which a landing must be effected. In cases where extremely
hazardous landing conditions exist such as dense bush, heavy seas or
mountainous terrain, the final decision as to the urgency of landing must be
made by the pilot.
Land immediately: Land at once, even if for example this
means ditching or landing in trees. The
consequences of continued flight are
likely to be more hazardous than those of
landing at a site normally considered
unsuitable.
Land as soon as possible: Do not continue flight for longer than is
necessary to achieve a safe and
unhurried landing at the nearest site.
Land as soon as practicable: Land at the nearest aviation location or, if
there is none reasonably close, at a safe
landing site selected for subsequent
convenience.
Malfunctions during approach guidance
Discontinue approach:
Throughout this section the Discontinue approach is reported whenever the
capability of the helicopter to continue the approach being flown is lost.
The crew actions in the event of failures resulting in Discontinue approach
depend on the operational situation and pre-flight planning should take into
account the possibility of the loss of ability to continue the approach, as per
normal VFR and IFR planning.
Considerations such as the specific kind of abnormal condition experienced,
the availability of re-configuration options, alternate approach procedures, the
environmental and meteorological conditions, kind of operation, fuel state,
alternate availability and any other pertinent elements should be taken into
account by the crew to take proper action.

DOUBLE ENGINE FAILURE
A sequential or simultaneous failure of both engines will require entry into
autorotation.
ENTRY IN AUTOROTATION
Depending on collective and airspeed at the time, a simultaneous or
ENG FAIL
sequential engine failure will result in a large and very rapid drop in rotor
SHT DWN
speed (NR) requiring a large and rapid collective adjustment in order to
recover and maintain rotor speed within the Power Off range. It is imperative
that these adjustment be made quickly and decisively.
IF the failure occurs at considerable height above ground level (AGL), it is
possible that sufficient time will be available for attempting an engine re-start
(assuming that the cause of the failure can be rapidly analysed). Assuming an
average autorotative sink rate of 2000 ft per minute, a minimum AGL height of
3000 to 5000 ft would be required to provide sufficient time to complete
engine restart procedures.
IF time and conditions permits and no attempt to restart is made, carry out the
ENGINE SHUTDOWN IN EMERGENCY procedure page 35 while the
helicopter is manoeuvred toward the landing area.
IF sufficient additional time is available to make an engine re-start feasible,
use the ENGINE START MALFUNCTIONS AND RESTART IN FLIGHT PRO-
CEDURE procedure page 131.

WARNING
As considerable error can result from estimation of height over
water, the radar altimeter should be used for height cues during
descent.
CAUTION
At high touchdown speeds, the rotorcraft may roll and turn to

ENGINE FAILURE
GENERAL
In the event of partial or complete power failure, establishing a safe flight con-
dition is the prime consideration, until the cause of the failure can be analysed.
Care should be taken in confirming the failed engine prior to commencing
ENG FAIL
engine shutdown as given in the ENGINE SHUTDOWN IN EMERGENCY
SHT DWN
procedure page 35.
ENGINE FAILURE RECOGNITION
The following cues could be available to the crew following a single or multiple
engine failure:
— Noticeable right sideslip (helicopter nose swinging to the left).
— Illumination of the CAS Warning 1(2) ENG OUT caption.
— An audible tone and an ”ENGINE 1(2) OUT” voice warning.
— The failed engine PI/TQ will split significantly from the operational
engine.
— Dependent on collective position at the time of the failure, a drop in
rotor speed (NR) may occur.
SINGLE ENGINE FAILURE
A single engine failure will result in an increase in PI/TQ on the live engine.
Depending on collective position and airspeed at the time of the failure, a drop
in rotor speed (NR) may occur requiring a collective adjustment in order to
maintain rotor speed within the Power On range.
If the execution of the ENGINE FAILURE procedure has resulted in shutting
down the engine, consider analyzing the cause of the failure with a view
toward re-starting the engine.
Refer to SINGLE ENGINE PROCEDURE, page 217.

and Figure Perf 53 assume the following flyaway procedure is followed:
1. Collective/Cyclic control — Rotate pitch down to an attitude
of -15°.
ENG FAIL — Maintain this attitude until 15 kts
SHT DWN GS, then rotate nose up to level
attitude and maintain for 1 second.
After 1 second continue rotation to
5° nose up and maintain to
accelerate to VFASS (45 KIAS).
Adjust collective to maintain NR
close to 93%.
2. Climb — When the aircraft reaches VFASS
(45 KIAS) adjust pitch attitude to
maintain airspeed.
— When a positive rate of climb is
achieved lower collective to
recover NR to 98%.
— Continue to climb accelerating to

LOSS OF TAIL ROTOR EFFECTIVENESS
Loss of tail rotor effectiveness will result in a rapid yaw to the right and a loss
of yaw control, possibly accompanied by noise or vibration in the tail section.
The severity of the initial yaw rate will be determined by the airspeed, altitude,
gross weight, center of gravity and torque settings at the time that the failure
occurs. The effectiveness of the vertical fin in limiting the yaw rate and yaw
angle will depend on the airspeed at the time of the failure, fin effectiveness
increasing at higher airspeeds.
The following cues will be present:
— Aircraft increase of yaw rate;
— Loss of yaw control, pedals free but ineffective;
— Possible noise and vibration from the aft fuselage area.
Severe yaw rates will result in large yaw angles within a very short period of
ROTOR time and, depending on the flight conditions at the time of failure, it is possible
XMSN that yaw angles in excess of 30° will be experienced.
Additionally, very high yaw rates will produce aircraft pitching and rolling mak-
ing retention of control difficult without the use of large cyclic inputs, which are
structurally undesirable. Finally, very high yaw rates will produce disorienting
effects on the pilots. Therefore, it is vital that corrective action, as outlined in
the following procedures, be taken quickly to prevent post-failure yaw rates
from reaching unacceptable high levels.
In Hover
— Lower collective to LAND IMMEDIATELY while maintaining attitude
and minimizing lateral translation with the cyclic control;
— Select both ENG MODE knobs to OFF if time available.
In Forward Flight
— Move collective immediately to minimize yaw rate (lowering the col-
lective to reduce yaw right / increasing the collective to reduce yaw
left);
— Establish a suitable airspeed/rate of descent/attitude combination to
reach a stable condition;
— At landing site assess running landing capability;
— If a running landing cannot be carried out with a suitable power and
speed, shutdown engines;
— Carry Out AUTOROTATIVE LANDING PROCEDURE ON LAND page 26
or AUTOROTATIVE LANDING PROCEDURE ON WATER page 28.
Note
— Land into wind;
— Raising or Lowering the collective while maintaining NR
within limits may be effective in helping control sideslip
(increase collective to reduce yaw left).

TRANSMISSION
TRANSMISSION SYSTEM FAILURES OR DEGRADATIONS
The most common transmission system (main, intermediate, tailrotor gearbox)
failures are of three general types:
— Lubrication system failure (oil pump, ducts, nozzles etc);
— Transmission component failure (gears, bearings, etc);
— Accessory component failure (hydraulic pumps, electrical generators,
coolers etc).
The transmissions are monitored with chip detectors, oil pressure and/or oil
temperature indicators as well as CAS Warning and Caution messages to
inform the pilot of the operating condition of the system. It is probable that one
or more of these indications will be present if a mechanical transmission fail-
ure is imminent. However, whether these indications are present or not, crew ROTOR
sensory perceptions such as:
XMSN
— abnormal mechanical noise, and/or:
— heavy vibration levels, and/or:
— the odour of hot metal fumes.
all play an important part in diagnosis of impending transmission system fail-
ures and assist the pilot in determining what actions are required.

ENGINE START MALFUNCTIONS AND RESTART IN FLIGHT
PROCEDURE
If an engine flames out/or is shutdown during flight and if there is no indication
of a mechanical malfunction or engine fire, the engine may be restarted.
In flight, should an engine re-starting be needed, only one attempt is available.
ABORTED ENGINE RESTART PROCEDURE
CAUTION
Failure to follow the aborted engine restart procedure may
cause damage to the engine.
Engine starting malfunctions are most likely to occur during the engine accel-
eration cycle to IDLE speed. The list below details the cockpit indications
associated with malfunctions and the recommended aborted engine restart
procedure. It is important that flight crews be thoroughly familiar with these
procedures.
Monitor engine start and if any of the following occurs:
— no light up within 10 seconds of ENG MODE knob to IDLE;
— ITT increases beyond engine limits;
— ITT goes invalid (shows X or blank);
— engine hangs (NG stagnation below 60%);
— if engine starter fails to disengage by 54% NG.
Shut down engine as follows:
ENG
1. ENG MODE knob — OFF. APU
2. FUEL ENG SOV — CLOSE.

FMS MESSAGES ON PFD
FMS DGR + RNP + MSG
FMS DGR is the main alerting (amber) message on the PFD for on-board Per-
formance Monitoring and Alerting System. FMS DGR is displayed when the
on-board Performance Monitoring and Alerting detects that the FMS cannot
guarantee, with sufficient integrity, the navigation performance required in the
navigation specification, in terms of the required position Accuracy (TSE/FTE
(Total System Error/Flight Tecnical Error) monitoring) and/or horizontal/vertical
Integrity (NSE ((Navigation System Error) monitoring), for the present phase
of flight.
The FMS DGR alert indicates the FMS loss of capability to validate the posi-
tion data provided by NAV sensors (e.g. GNSS receivers).

Lateral Deviation Pointer with Winglets on Approach
During the approach phase (“APP green annunciation on PFD) or during the
RNP 0.3 procedure the FMS displays a linear lateral deviation pointer with
winglets below the attitude. The winglets’ size are equal to the current EPU
value but they are displayed besides the pointer only if the EPU > 20% of
RNP.
The lateral deviation pointer, and winglets, when appropriate, are displayed in
the cyan (uncoupled)/magenta (coupled) colour with the AFCS Lateral NAPP
or NAV mode while they are displayed in amber colour for conditions of:

SINGLE ENGINE PROCEDURE
The following procedure intends to indicate the procedures to follow, in OEI
conditions, following a emergeny or malfunction procedure which has caused
an engine failure or an intentional shutdown.
After an engine shutdown, the indication of fuel quantity on PFD and on MFD
ENGINE synoptic page will change as follows:
— if the fuel quantity associated to the failed engine is greater than 160 kg,
the quantity exceeding 160 kg is added to the quantity of the operative
engine and the Total Fuel Quantity coincides with it. The Fuel Quantity of
the failed engine is displayed in grey inverse video as 160 kg.
— if the fuel quantity associated to the failed engine is lower than 160 kg, the
Total Fuel Quantity coincides with the fuel quantity indication of the opera-
tive engine. The Fuel Quantity readout associated to the failed engine
turns to grey inverse video.
Note
Consider increased unusable fuel affecting flight duration.
When conditions permit confirm the following:
1. Carry out ENGINE SHUTDOWN IN EMERGENCY procedure,
refer page 35.

WARNINGS, CAUTIONS AND NOTES
Warnings, Cautions and Notes are used throughout this manual to emphasize
important and critical instructions and are used as follows:
WARNING
An operating procedure, practice, etc., which, if not correctly fol-
lowed, could result in personal injury or loss of life.
CAUTION
An operating procedure, practice, etc., which, if not strictly
observed, could result in damage to, or destruction of,
equipment.
Note
An operating procedure, condition, etc., which is essential to
highlight.
USE OF PROCEDURAL WORDS
The concept of procedural word usage and intended meaning which has been
adhered to in preparing this QRH is as follows:
”Shall” or ”Must” have been used only when application of a procedure is
mandatory.
”Should” has been used only when application of a procedure is re-
commended.
”May” has been used only when application of a procedure is optional.
”Will” has been used only to indicate futurity, never to indicate a mandatory
procedure.
”Condition” has been used to determine if the item under examination
presents external damage which could jeopardize its safe operation.
”Secure” has been used to determine if the item under examination is
correctly locked, referring to doors and disconnectable items, or correctly
positioned and installed.
DEFINITIONS
The level of alertness required by the pilots is a function of the flight regime.
The following definitions are used in the manual;
Fly Attentive - Pilot to maintain close control of the flight path using hands/
feet on when required.
Fly Manually - Pilot to control directly the flight path using hands/feet on.
QFE - Atmospheric pressure at aerodrome elevation (or runway threshold).
QNH - Altimeter subscale setting to obtain elevation when on the ground.
PRESSURE ALTITUDE - Obtained by setting barometer pressure to 1013 hPa
or STD or 29.92"Hg.

— Category A operation;
— Operations with more than 9 passenger seats.
CAT A operations are approved under Day/Night.
CATEGORY A TAKE-OFF
Weather conditions must be such that external visual references exist in the
FATO area and in the Take-Off distance.
CATEGORY A LANDING
Weather conditions must be such that approach to LDP is carried out with
visual reference in the FATO area and in the balked landing distance.
MINIMUM FLIGHT CREW
Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Day/Night and IFR - One pilot unless otherwise
required by operating rules. Single pilot operation not permitted from left seat.
CAT A - CREW LIMITATIONS
CAT A Take-Off and Landing can be carried out from the right or left hand
seat.
When Take-Off or Landing is carried out from the left hand seat minimum flight
crew is 2 pilots.
NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS
The maximum number of occupants, including the crew, shall not exceed 10
for basic approved configurations. For the maximum number of occupants for
other approved configurations refer to appropriate Supplements of Section 5
of RFM.
Each occupant must have a seat with seat belt and shoulder harness.
For all approved cabin configurations refer to appropriate Supplements of
Section 5 and Section 6, Weight and Balance.
It is permissible to reduce the number of seats installed in the cabin respecting
the requirements found for each layout in Section 6 of the Basic RFM or
appropriate Supplement.
After any configuration change the new empty weight and CG position must
be determined and entered into Section 6 to ensure CG limits are not
exceeded.

CATEGORY B OPERATION LIMITATIONS (UP TO 9 PASSENGER SEATS)
The CAT B WMAT Limit charts, Figure Lim 5 thru Figure Lim 34 define the
maximum HIGE Take-Off and Landing weight for:
• the given ambient conditions (OAT, Hp);
• Electrical load: 75% means that an electrical load of 75% on each DC
generator has been included;
• Electrical load: 25% means that an electrical load of 25% on each DC
generator has been included;
• Figure Lim 5 thru Figure Lim 34 will be used if the wind and Take-Off /
Landing directions do not differ more than 10°.
Note
When wind and Take-Off directions differ more than 10°, Figure
Perf 7 shows wind envelope and azimuth.
The associated Take-Off and landing weight is found in Section

LIMS
Accounting for internal arrangements with more than 9 passengers, CAT B WAT
charts are defined taking into account also OEI climb capability requirements.
Therefore CAT B WAT Limit charts shown in Figure Lim 5 thru Figure Lim 34
are replaced by Figure Lim 35 and Figure Lim 36 with the same wind enve-
lope define in Figure Perf 7.
In case one or more seats are removed from the approved configuration and
total passenger seats return up to 9, Cat B WAT charts Figure Lim 5 thru
Figure Lim 34 may be used and the following Height-Velocity limitations
paragraph does not apply.
CAT B Take-Off and Landing with tail wind is prohibited.
The CAT B WAT Limit charts, Figure Lim 35 and Figure Lim 36 is used to
define the maximum Take-Off and Landing weight for:
• the given ambient conditions (OAT, Hp);
• Electrical load: 75% means that an electrical load of 75% on each DC
generator has been included
• Electrical load: 25% means that an electrical load of 25% on each DC
generator has been included.
CAUTION
Supplement 30 configuration required for operations above
4600 kg.
Note
The weights specified from Figure Lim 35 and Figure Lim 36
above refer to the clean aircraft configuration. When kits,
impacting external profile, are fitted, refer to PERFORMANCE
CORRECTION AFTER KIT INSTALLATION section 4 of sup-
plement 29 of basic RFM.
The Height-Velocity envelope has been split between the high hover condi-
tions and the Take-Off corridor. The procedures defined in Emergency Proce-
dures and associated weights defined in Figure Perf 52 thru Figure Perf 61
guarantee a SafeVertical Reject or Flyways can always be carried out in a
safe manner from hover out of ground effect following a single engine failure.
A safe vertical reject can always be carried out from HIGE condition as fol-
lows:
— up to 15 ft for weight up to 4600 kg
— up to 15 ft up to 5000 ft for weight in excess of 4600 kg up to 4800 kg
— up to 10 ft up to 10000 ft for weight in excess of 4600 kg up to 4800 kg
Cat B Take-Off and Landing procedure, included in Normal Procedures and
WAT charts, included in CHARTS DIAGS, ensures the aircraft is within the
Take-Off corridor of the H-V envelope.

NORMAL PROCEDURES
GENERAL
The normal procedures detailed hereafter are the result of extensive flight
tests and experience with the AW169 aircraft. They are fundamental to ensure
that the level of safety required by the design and certification process is
achieved.
Note
Throughout this Section, checks marked with a large are
required once every 24 hour period. All other checks are to be
carried out before each flight.
Normal and standard conditions are assumed in these procedures. Pertinent
data in other sections is referenced where applicable.
EXT/INT
Capital letters are used in the procedures to indicate the labeling of switches, CHECKS
selections to be made or caution/warning messages.
The minimum and maximum limits, and the normal and cautionary operating
ranges are indicated on the PFD and MFD displays, Refer to Section 1 for
details on operating limitations.
Each time an operating limitation is exceeded, an appropriate entry must be
made in the log book (helicopter, engine, etc.). The entry shall state which limit
was exceeded, duration, the extreme value attained, and any additional
information essential in determining the maintenance action required.

CATEGORY B WEIGHT DETERMINATION
In order to determine maximum weight for Category B HIGE Take-Off and
Landing refer to Figure Lim 5 and Figure Lim 6 as indicated in CATEGORY B
OPERATION LIMITATIONS (UP TO 9 PASSENGER SEATS).
GROSS WEIGHT AND CENTER OF GRAVITY
Determine both the Take-Off and estimated landing Gross Weight, Center of
Gravity and verify that they are within approved envelope limits. The Weight
and Balance, Section 6 of RFM, and appropriate performance charts, Section
4 of RFM, must be used to obtain the weight and balance data as follows:
— Consult Section 6 of RFM Weight and Balance;
EXT/INT
— Ascertain weight of fuel, oil, payload etc.;
CHECKS
— Compute Take-Off and anticipated gross landing weight (RFM Section 4);
— Check helicopter centre of gravity (CG) position;
— Confirm that the weight and CG limitations at page 6 are not exceeded.

COLD WEATHER OPERATION
Extremely low temperatures can produce adverse effects on the aircraft.
These effects can include cracking and/or deterioration of non-metallic
materials such as plexiglass, rubber, synthetic rubber and plastics.
CAUTION
If the aircraft has been parked outside in snow or icing
conditions, ensure that the deicing procedure detailed in the
Maintenance Manual has been completed and that ice and
snow have not re-accumulated since its completion.
Very cold temperatures can cause low engine and high transmission oil
pressures during the starting sequence.
EXT/INT
If the helicopter is to remain parked outside with an OAT at or below -20 °C
CHECKS
both Main and Auxiliary batteries must be removed and stored in a heated
room.
As general indication if the aicraft has been exposed to OAT not below -10 °C
for any time duration or between -10 °C to -20 C for less than 2 hours or
between - 20 °C to -40 °C for less than 30 minutes, it can be considered NOT
COLD SOAKED.
It is recommended to use DC EXT PWR to start engines after cold soak as
automatic abort engine start might occur with HOT START caution
illumination when using aircraft batteries.
When the aircraft has been subject to cold soak the NORMAL PROCEDURES
need to be supplemented.
The SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR POST-COLD SOAK START
are given in this paragraph with references, where necessary, to the NORMAL
PROCEDURES in this Section.
SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR POST-COLD SOAK START
1. Remove all blanks and covers.
2. Re-install batteries in accordance with the procedure of the Aircraft
Maintenance Manual.
3. Complete PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS, special attention should be focused on
components such as landing gear shock absorbers, tires, seals, etc., to
ensure that these components are in airworthy condition prior to
departure.
4. Complete COCKPIT SAFETY CHECKS.
5. Complete ENGINE PRE-START CHECKS.
6. Carry out ENGINE START procedure up to step 22., (Engine 1 start in
Accessory mode).

When MGB oil is very cold, pressure indication is slow to rise but then it may
exceed the normal range. The MGB oil pressure is regulated in order to
optimize the operative conditions. During cold starting operations the MGB oil
pressure could temporary reach values up to 6.7 bar (0.7 bar above the
normal range).
This is normal since the oil pressure decreases as oil temperature rises.
The pressure could still be in the cautionary range when the ENG MODE knob
is moved from IDLE to FLT.
Do not apply power until the MGB oil pressure and temperature are in the
normal range.
2 M GB OIL PRESS caution may temporarily display, when starting post
cold soak in Accessory mode.
7. Carry out cyclic, collective and yaw pedals full and free using the following
procedure.
EXT/INT
—Exercise the flight controls progressively and slowly.
CHECKS
—Set collective to approximately 50% and exercise cyclic alternatively
fore/aft and left/right progressively increasing the stroke until full dis-
placement. Repeat full displacement 3 times.
—Set cyclic centered and exercise collective progressively increasing the
stroke until full displacement. Repeat full displacement 3 times.
—Exercise yaw pedals progressively increasing the stroke until full dis-
placement. Repeat full displacement 3 times.
8. Centralize yaw pedals and set collective to MPOG.
Centralize cyclic control by moving in the direction indicated by the yellow
arrows to obtain the central circle green, using the control position
indicator, on PFD.
9. Carry out ENGINE START procedure from step 24. to step 46.
10. Engage AP 1 and AP 2 monitoring HYD 1 and HYD 2 temperatures.
11. Make small cyclic, collective and pedals movements.
12. Check HYD 1 and HYD 2 temperatures first dropping and then rising.
13. Dis-engage AP 1 and AP 2.
14. Select TEST on AFCS control panel, when HYD 1 and HYD 2
temperatures reach 10 °C.
15. Carry out AFTER ENGINE START CHECKS, see page 144.

PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS
The inspection commences at the nose and continues clockwise around the
helicopter. During the inspection, check that there are no leaks from overboard
drains, that all vents, air intakes, air outlets and fire access points are clear of
obstructions, and all access panels and antennas are secure.
DAILY PRE-FLIGHT CHECK TO BE DONE BEFORE REFUELLING
Fuel tank water bleeding has to be done before the first flight of the day by a
trained person before moving the aircraft. Drain shall take about 25 seconds
for each tank sump.
The term "trained person" means a Mechanic or a pilot who has received
sufficient training to perform these tasks.

ABORTED ENGINE START PROCEDURE
CAUTION
Failure to follow the aborted engine start procedure may cause
damage to the engine.
Engine starting malfunctions are most likely to occur during the engine
acceleration cycle to IDLE speed. The list below details the cockpit indications
associated with malfunctions and the recommended aborted engine start
procedure. It is important for flight crews to be thoroughly familiar with these
procedures.
Monitor engine start and if any of the following occurs:
— no light up within 10 seconds of ENG MODE knob to IDLE;
— ITT increases beyond engine limits ( HOT START caution illuminated);
— ITT goes invalid (shows X or blank); ENG
START
— engine hangs (NG stagnation below 60%);
— if engine starter fails to disengage by 54% NG.
Shut down engine as follows:
1. ENG MODE knob — OFF.
2. FUEL ENG SOV — CLOSE.
(EDCU, FUEL page)
CAUTION
On ground, should an engine starting procedure be aborted,
electrical power must be switched off completely before
motoring or re-starting operations.
MOTORING PROCEDURE
Following an aborted start shutdown, perform the following procedure to clear
internally trapped fuel and vapor.
Choose one of the following three cycles:
No Cycle
1 45 seconds on, 10 minutes off
2 30 seconds on, 5 minutes off
3 15 seconds on, 2 minutes off
The chosen cycle can be repeated 3 times. If further motoring is requested, 30
minutes rest time is necessary.

It is recommended to start the engine2 to IDLE. If necessary, it
is possible to start the engine to FLT by setting the ENG MODE
knob directly to FLT. In this case spurius 2 ENG OUT
warning will transiently display with associated aural.
Note
The MGB oil pressure is regulated in order to optimize the
operative conditions. During cold starting operations the MGB
oil pressure could temporary reach values up to 6.7 bar (0.7 bar
above normal range). This is normal since the oil pressure
decreases as oil temperature rises. The pressure could still be
in the cautionary range when the ENG MODE knob is moved
from IDLE to FLT. Do not apply power until the MGB oil pressure
and temperature are in the normal range.

QUICK START PROCEDURE
PREPARATION FOR QUICK START
The following procedure allows the operator to prepare the aircraft for quick
start. The pilot will be able to start the engines and launch the rotor in a
minimum amount of time. Prior to assuming a quick start status, the helicopter
will be run-up (or flown) to include completion of the following checks, in the
last 24 hours:
• PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS (including checks required by Optional
Equipments);
• SAFETY CHECKS;
• ENGINE PRE-START CHECKS (including checks required by
Optional Equipments);
• ENGINE STARTING;
• AFTER ENGINE START CHECKS (including checks required by
Optional Equipments); ENG
• POST LANDING AND SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES; START
• PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS (to be repeated after each flight including
checks required by Optional Equipments).
If the aircraft is shutdown using ENGINES AND ROTOR SHUTDOWN
(ENGINE 1 MAIN MODE) the QUICK START PROCEDURE will be faster
than using ENGINES AND ROTOR SHUTDOWN (ENGINE 1 ACCESSORY
MODE). However either one or the other procedure can be used.
Quick start status can also be achieved if a flight has already been completed
in the last 24 hours and all the checks detailed above have been successfully
carried out.
If the aircraft has been exposed for long time to cold temperature the duration
of this procedure is affected as HYD and MGB oil warm up time will be longer.
The QUICK START PROCEDURE, that follows, may only be used:
— when no maintenance nor cowlings opening have been done after the
QUICK START PROCEDURE PREPARATION has been completed and
— the aircraft has NOT been COLD SOAKED.
As general indication the aircraft can be considered NOT COLD SOAKED
if it has been exposed to OAT:
• not below -10°C for any time duration or
• between -10°C to -20°C for less than 2 hours or
• between -20°C to -40°C for less than 30 minutes.
QUICK START PROCEDURE

FLIGHT HANDLING
The rotation of the main rotor is anti-clockwise when viewed from above.
Handling is conventional in normal forward, sideways and rearwards flight
manoeuvres. Collective lever forces are light, but may be increased by
applying friction.
AUTOROTATIVE DESCENT
1. Smoothly reduce collective to enter autorotation.
2. Maximum NR 110%.
CAUTION
Rotor speed is sensitive in low power descent and autorotation
and large NR changes are produced by changes in normal
acceleration (G). Care is needed to avoid exceeding limits.
3. Adjust attitude to obtain approximately 75 KIAS.
4. To recover to powered flight, slowly increase collective pitch until
freewheels are joined and at least 10% torque is indicated. Finally,
increase power, gently, in not less than 3 seconds, to arrest the rate of
descent.
IN
FLIGHT
FLIGHT IN MODERATE OR SEVERE TURBULENCE
1. All occupants must be seated with seat belts fastened.
2. Slow aircraft airspeed as required.
3. Fly attentive.

FLIGHT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OPERATION
PRE-DEPARTURE OPERATIONS
— On EDCU HOME page, press INIT to enter the weight data on WEIGHT &
BALANCE EDCU page and the FMS performance data on PERF INIT 1/2
and 2/2 EDCU pages as required.
— Press CONFIRM on INIT EDCU page to have the computation of Progress
Data and to allow the Baro-VNAV capability in arrival/approach.
— If P-RAIM for destination is required, due to out of SBAS coverage or dur-
ing SBAS outage, press PROGRESS-POS SENSOR EDCU page and
select the GPS unit to use. Press the PRED-RAIM button to perform the
Predictive RAIM function on Destination waypoint. In the event of a pre-
dicted (P-RAIM) HIL above the required RNP for more than 5 minutes for
any part of the RNP operation, the flight planning should be revised (e.g.
delaying the departure or planning a different ATS route).
IN-FLIGHT OPERATIONS
General
The ACTIVE FLIGHT PLAN and PROGRESS EDCU pages are considered
the primary pages of the FMS during flight providing the Distance, ETE,
Altitude constrains, RNP and current EPU (Estimated Position Uncertainty
also known as Actual Navigation Performance) of aircraft during
Performancebased Navigation.
Once activated, the active flight plan may be flown coupled to AFCS through
the NAV mode (Lateral Guidance) in Climb and Cruise phases while in
Descent phase during the approach with APP (for Lateral and Vertical
Guidance) and DCL (for Longitudinal Guidance) modes. The DCL
(deceleration) mode provides the AFCS with longitudinal steering for
automatic deceleration at the distances/speeds set on the FMS APPROACH
SPEEDS EDCU page.
For Vertical control in Terminal and/or Approach (with exclusion of final FD/FMS
approach segment of LPV approach) the FMS provides an “Approved Baro-
OPER
VNAV” guidance using the Baro-corrected altitude to determine the helicopter
position with respect to the VPATH.
When Active Flight Plan contains an Approach procedure, the BARO VNAV
DATA EDCU page is also a primary page of FMS containing information
relevant to the vertical profile computed by the FMS as TOD (Top of Descent)
position, BOD (Bottom Of Descent) position, Vertical Track Error respect to
computed glide-path and GPA (Glide Path Angle).
Note
For vertical profile computation in arrival and approach
procedures, pilot must execute the PERF INIT function to allow
the VNAV computation and steering to AFCS. During departure
and en-route, VNAV function is not available.

Volume AP8.0
The FMS is CDO (Continuous Descent Operation) capable if all Altitude
constraints are satisfied by the continuous descent vertical profile computed
by the FMS. Otherwise the FMS automatically computes a VPATH that follows
the procedure's altitude constraints drawing a 'step-descent' vertical profile.
The FMS computes and displays the TOD position only if the VNAV phase is
CRUISE and the aircraft is within the Terminal Area (range distance below
30 NM to Destination).
Note
The FMS manages maximum Glide Path Angle for approach up
to 9.0 Degrees.
Note
The FMS allows entering in Active Flight Plan altitude and
speed constraints on en-route waypoints but they are only
displayed as reference information without any effect on en-
route VNAV.
FLIGHT PROGRESS should be monitored for navigational reasonableness,
by cross-checks with conventional NAVAIDs using the primary displays in con-
junction with the RNAV Navigation data on PFD/MFD.
For the ILS and LOC approaches the FMS enables the loading of the proce-
dure from NAV DB into the ACTIVE FLIGHT PLAN EDCU page in order to
provide the Lateral guidance up to correct interception of the Localizer cone of
ILS/LOC approach before the FAP.
The LOC preview PFD function has to be activated for the automatic transition
from FMS to ILS navigation source to fly the FAS (Final Approach Segment)
with LOC/GS modes. The pilot is not authorized to fly the FAS segment from
FAP to MAP with NAV mode only. The FAS segment must be flown with APP
mode (LOC/GS modes).
Note
FD/FMS If a Data Base Update (DBU) is required and executed by
pressing AVIONICS and DBU START button during Cruise
OPER
phase (CRUISE displayed con ACTIVE FLIGHT PLAN EDCU
page) or on-ground, the pilot must repeat the PERF INIT with
the previously inserted values.
Departure, Climb
Set CRUISE ALTITUDE in PERF INIT 2/2 EDCU page as Initial Cruise
Altitude; set altitude selector (ALTA) at the same Initial Cruise reference
altitude or above as cleared by ATC/ACC to achieve the CRUISE VNAV
phase.
If required, activate the SID procedure of origin airport from NAV DB.

Note
The FMS automatically updates the CRUISE ALTITUDE in

• ALT mode engagement (synchronization with current baro
altitude);
• Altitude/flight level change carried out with ALTA
(synchronization with pre-selected baro altitude);
• Altitude/flight level change carried out with ALT
(synchronization with current baro altitude datum);
• FMS approach activation on EDCU (synchronization with
current baro altitude).
— Monitor the leg of active flight plan sequencing on MFD (FPLN pages:
Rose, Arc, Plan) and/or on the EDCU display (ACTIVE FLIGHT PLAN
pages).
— Monitor the Lateral Path Deviation with respect to the DTK of active leg on
PFD and/or the XTK (Cross Track Error) value on MFD.
Descent
— If required, activate TEMPERATURE COMPENSATION function (refer to
FMS AW169 Pilot's Guide for details).
— If DCL required, confirm/set the distances/speeds on the APPROACH
SPEEDS EDCU page.
— In Terminal area adjust/verify the correct QNH setting on both PFDs.
Note
ALT cyan annunciation is displayed on the PFD for altitude
mismatch of ±75 ft between the pilot and copilot altimeters.
— Within Terminal area verify the VGP (or VFR) annunciation displayed in
FD/FMS
armed mode (in white colour). Only if FMS approach with LPV or LP min-
OPER
ima is loaded, verify in addition the LPV (or LP) annunciation displayed in
armed mode (in white colour) above the VGP.
— Within the Terminal area, if one or more Altitude constraints (“AT”, “AT or
ABOVE”, “AT or BELOW”) are defined in the active flight plan, and the
TOD is located before the IAF (Initial Approach Fix), follow the VPATH and
the Vertical deviation pointer on Vertical scale manually or with VS mode.
— Before the TOD waypoint in arrival and approach verify, on ACTIVE
FLIGHT PLAN EDCU page, on MFD VSD (Vertical Situation Display) or on
MFD FMW (Flight Management Window), the VNAV phase equal to
CRUISE (CRZ on VSD).
— If VNAV phase is not CRUISE, set CRUISE ALTITUDE in PERF INIT 2/2
EDCU page and press CONFIRM button.
— If a fully coupled approach is required, arm the APP mode on AFCS Con-
trol Panel (and DCL for longitudinal axis, if required) to fly the VPATH of
approach fully coupled on collective axis (and longitudinal axis) up to MAP
waypoint. The APP mode for VPATH coupled operation (NAPP or NGS)
engages only after passing the IAF waypoint.

COLLECTIVE MODES TRANSITIONS DURING FMS APPROACHES
The FMS BOD or MAP waypoint, for CDO, is the VPATH anchor point com-
puted by the FMS.
During NPA/RNP APCH coupled on vertical axis (NAPP mode engaged) the

USER DEFINED APPROACHES
VFR Approach
The FMS provides the capability to activate a customized approach procedure
(VFR Approach) on the last waypoint of the ACTIVE FLIGHT PLAN (Destina-
tion Waypoint). The Destination Waypoint can be any USER waypoint or a
waypoint belonging to the STD NAV DB, as airport or heliport. The availability
of the VFR Approach requires only the following pre-requisites to be satisfied:
— On the Destination Waypoint an IFR Arrival (if any is available) has not
been activated;
— On the Destination Waypoint is not associated or active any Holding pat-
tern.
The VFR Approach is flexible and it can be customized in terms of the follow-
ing main parameters: Approach Course, Glide Path Angle, Missed Approach
Course and Altitude and MAP height.
The VFR approach function creates a Final Approach Segment consisting of a
FAF point located 3 nm from the destination waypoint and a lead-in leg of vari-
able length (as a function of selected GPA and waypoint altitude) providing lat-
eral and vertical guidance to the Destination waypoint with the same
performance of Non-Precision Approach and can be coupled to APP (+DCL)
mode of the AFCS as for Non Precision Approaches.
To activate a VFR approach the following data has to be inserted on the
approach definition EDCU page:
• Approach Course;
• Missed Approach Course;
• Glide Path Angle (3° to 9°);
FD/FMS • TDZE (Touch-Down Zone Elevation) or LDG SURF EL (Landing Sur-
OPER face Elevation);
• TCH (Threshold Crossing Height) or CROSS HGT (Crossing Height);
• Missed Approach Altitude.

pilot can insert. For Approaches with GPA less than 7.5 deg, 40 ft is the FD/FMS
minimum value that pilot can insert as TCH/ CROSS HGT.
OPER
The VFR Approach may be created on Heliport or Airport, provided that pilot
selects via VFR EDCU page the desired Pad or Runway, if more than one is
available within STD NAV DB. The FMS automatically selects and displays on
VFR EDCU page the Pad or the Runway ID and position, if it is unique.
The VFR Approach provides a basic Missed Approach procedure which con-
sists of a course-to-fix leg (3 nm length) and an holding on the MAHWP.
Note
During VFR Approach (MAP profile included) it is the pilot's
responsibility to ensure that the aircraft flight path will be clear of
obstacles.

VSD (VERTICAL SITUATION DISPLAY)
The Vertical Situation Display (VSD) intended function is to enhance flight
crew awareness of the vertical situation in Terminal area and during approach.
Information is provided on MFD. The VSD represents a profile view of helicop-
ter and the corresponding FMS VPATH in arrival/approach through the TOD
(Top Of Descent) position, VPATH Predicted Altitudes and flight plan Altitude
constraints along the current Track.
The VSD is the vertical counterpart to the horizontal map display. When A/C is
out of track with a XTK exceeding the RNP value, the VSD information is
removed and replaced by the OUT OF SWATH amber message.
The VSD is not intended to be used for VPATH control or for obstacle/ground
separation which remains under pilot's responsibility.
The VSD is not displayed during the execution of the Discontinuity of the flight
plan.
FLIGHT MANAGEMENT WINDOW
The Flight Management Window (FMW) includes Active Flight Plan data and
Real Time Performance data.
The Active Flight Plan data are displayed in the upper part of the FMW and
replicates the ACTIVE FLIGHT PLAN EDCU page layout allowing the Pilot to
check the active flight plan in primary field of view.
The Helicopter Real Time Performance data are displayed in the bottom part
of the FMW. The data provided are computed based on chart and according to
the current FMS phase of flight (i.e. Ground, Climb, Cruise, Hover).
CAUTION
Helicopter performance must be determined using the
performance charts in relevant Sections of RFM. The Real Time

OPERATIONS IN ABNORMAL MAGNETIC ENVIRONMENT
When AHRS is exposed to abnormal magnetic environment (e.g. magnetic
disturbances introduced by ships, oil rigs, iron mines, electrical power plants/
lines, high latitude etc...) automatic switching from Magnetic (MAG) to Direc-
tional Gyro (DG) mode occurs. This is annunciated by the PFD CAS message
1(2) DG MODE or 1-2 DG MODE and by PFD HSI DG caption (see Figure
NP 12). As a consequence, heading indication provided by the sensor operat-
ing in DG mode will differ from the indication provided by the sensor operating
in MAG mode.

The heading drift will affect on board systems which will present erroneous
indications as follows:
— MFD/PFD maps orientation;
— SVS and Flight Path Vector orientation;
— HSI orientation;
— Wind vector magnitude and orientation;
— Groundspeed vector orientation with respect to the helicopter longitudinal
and lateral axes;
— DF and ADF (if installed) pointer's orientation.
In spite of heading drift the following indications and functions remain correct:
— Forward flight track information with respect to geographical reference
system (North-East) even if HSI orientation is incorrect being affected by
heading drift;
— Groundspeed vector magnitude;
— Groundspeed vector orientation with respect to geographical reference
system (North-East) even if HSI orientation is incorrect being affected by
heading drift;
— FMS1(2) and VOR1(2) navigation pointer's orientation with respect to
geographical reference system (North-East) even if HSI orientation is
incorrect being affected by heading drift;
— During approaches (LPV, NAPP, ILS, VOR) lateral and vertical deviation
and Course Deviation Indicator selection are not affected by heading drift.

TRANSITION IN ABNORMAL MAGNETIC ENVIRONMENT DURING
SENSOR INITIALIZATION
When the helicopter is powered-up in an area subjected to localized magnetic
disturbances, transition from nominal magnetic environment to abnormal
magnetic environment may occur (e.g. during towing and taxing). If this transition
occurs when the sensor is initialized in MAG mode but DG mode is not available
yet (1(2) DG MODE or 1-2 DG MODE CAS message not yet temporarily
displayed on PFD), MAG DEGR caption will be displayed and the heading
readout will be set to - - - (see Figure NP 14) to inform the pilot that the magnetic
heading information is unreliable. The MAG DEGR caption will be cleared as
soon as DG mode is available, in this case automatic transition to DG mode will
occur and the system will no longer rely on magnetic information. To restore the
correct heading value after the transition to DG mode, the pilot shall selected
MAG mode as soon as 1(2) MAG MODE AVAIL advisory is displayed, or
perform either ON GROUND ALIGNMENT PROCEDURE or IN FLIGHT
ALIGNMENT PROCEDURES as applicable if MAG mode remains not available.

HEADING MISCOMPARE
As a consequence of the heading drift, in case heading discrepancy between
AHRS1 and AHRS2 exceeds 10 degrees, the caption HDG will be shown on
the HSI.

ALIGNMENT PROCEDURES
OPER
To nullify the effect of heading drift, a ground procedure and two types of for-
ward flight alignment procedures are available to the pilot:
— ON GROUND ALIGNMENT PROCEDURE
— IN FLIGHT ALIGNMENT PROCEDURES
The execution of these procedures will reduce pilot workload restoring ade-
quate AFCS performances and displaying all the correct and coherent infor-
mation on cockpit displays allowing the nominal availability of AFCS modes.
The following procedures apply:
On ground alignment procedure
AHRS in DG mode: PFD menu 2/2 AHRS1(2) - SYNC 1(2) + +: operate to
align heading readout with runway heading or ground reference.

— AHRS in DG mode: PFD menu 2/2 AHRS1(2) - SYNC 1(2) + +: oper-
ate to set the track along helicopter longitudinal axis (track-on-the-
nose) (see Figure NP 17).
— Perform a series of turns using at least rate-one angle of bank (the
higher the angle of bank and groundspeed, the more effective the
maneuver will be) to achieve a total heading change of at least 360
degrees (see Figure NP 16).
— AHRS1-AHRS2 heading difference: confirm within 3 degrees.

AFCS MODES OPERATIONS - GENERAL
AFCS performances of cruise and approach modes are not impacted by head-
ing drift.
In case any of the AHRS sensor is operating in DG mode, ATT heading hold
function is replaced by ATT yaw rate hold function. Both Pilot and Copilot col-
lective lateral beepers are not active except during operations with HDG mode
active at low speed.

The execution of the proper ALIGNMENT PROCEDURE will reduce pilot
workload and display all the correct and coherent information on cockpit dis-
plays allowing the nominal availability of AFCS modes. Performance of AFCS
Cruise and Approach modes will be guaranteed independently from the head-
ing drift.
AFCS MODES OPERATIONS - PROCEDURES
HDG/NAV/VOR operations (SID, ENROUTE, STAR)
— ON GROUND ALIGNMENT PROCEDURE: execute immediately
before performing SID
— IN FLIGHT ALIGNMENT PROCEDURE: execute immediately before
engaging NAV/HDG/VOR modes to reduce pilot workload and display
all the correct and coherent information on cockpit displays
— NAV/HDG/VOR modes: operate normally
Note
HDG caption displayed on PFD implies a heading miscompare
condition. HDG mode will disengage, if active, or will not be
available.
Approach operations
— IN FLIGHT ALIGNMENT PROCEDURE: execute immediately before
engaging APP modes to reduce pilot workload and display all the correct
and coherent information on cockpit displays

AUTO HOV OPERATIONS
Auto HOV Protection (AHP) mechanism
An additional consequence of heading drift is the degradation of HOV ground-
speed datum hold performance. This could result in degraded attitude hold
performance up to the point where the Auto HOV Protection mechanism inter-
venes.
The AHP mechanism prevents degradation of attitude control, warning the
pilots by means of EXCESSIVE DEVIATION chevrons displayed on PFD (see
Figure NP 26) and by aural double chime and, in case of marginal stability, by
HOV mode longitudinal and lateral axis disengagement and transition to ATT
mode which will be characterized by nominal attitude hold performance. Verti-
cal control axis remains engaged and operative.
FD/FMS
OPER
ICN-69-A-152000-G-A0126-01016-A-01-1
Figure NP 26: PFD - Excessive deviation chevron
Safety considerations
Auto HOV operations are safely achievable considering the availability to the
pilot of two different “safety barriers”:
— ON GROUND/IN FLIGHT ALIGNMENT PROCEDURES
— Auto Hover Protection mechanism
Therefore in case of initial incipient degradation of Auto HOV performance the
pilot shall perform the appropriate ALIGNMENT PROCEDURE to avoid the
intervention of AHP protection.

HOVER CEILING
The Hover Ceiling charts define the maximum weights at which an IGE hover
(at 6 ft (1.8 m) wheel height) or an OGE hover is possible for varying combina-
tions of Pressure Altitude, and OAT with main rotor speed at 103%. The charts
presented are for:
a) IGE with zero wind conditions.
b) IGE with wind controllability in excess of 17 kts (See Figure Perf 8
thru Figure Perf 11).
c) OGE with zero wind conditions.
The Unfactored Headwind Benefit table displays the full performance
increase resulting from the actual headwind component.
d) OGE with wind controllability (See Figure Perf 31, Figure Perf 9, Fig-
ure Perf 14 and Figure Perf 16).
Note
Unless otherwise authorized by operating regulations, the pilot
is not authorized to credit more than 50 percent of the
performance increase resulting from the actual headwind
component.
The charts for All Engines Operating AEO conditions are presented Take-Off
Power (TOP) and Maximum Continuous Power (MCP) with two different level
of electrical loads:
— Electrical load: 75% means that an electrical load of 75% on each DC gen-
erator has been included.
— Electrical load: 25% means that an electrical load of 25% on each DC gen-
erator has been included.
The charts for One Engine Inoperative (OEI) are presented for:
— OEI 2.5min rating with electrical load of 100% on remaining DC GEN
included.
— OEI Continuous rating with electrical load of 75% on remaining DC GEN
included.
At the bottom of HOVER OGE CEILING charts a table is given to allow the
pilot to calculate an increase of the Hover weight by taking advantage of the
headwind. The increase of Gross weight is unfactored and as specified in para
HEADWIND BENEFIT, unless otherwise authorized by operating regulations
only 50% of the performance increase resulting from the actual headwind
component can be used.

RATE OF CLIMB
The climb performance shown is based on flight test results and covers a range
of gross weights from 3200 kg to the Maximum Gross Weight of 4600 kg.
Rate of Climb performance is given at V .
Y
The charts for All Engines Operating AEO conditions are presented Take-Off
Power (TOP) and Maximum Continuous Power (MCP) with two different level
of electrical loads:
— Electrical load: 75% means that an electrical load of 75% on each DC gen-
erator has been included.
— Electrical load: 25% means that an electrical load of 25% on each DC
generator has been included.
The charts for One Engine Inoperative (OEI) are presented for OEI 2.5 min
power and OEI Continuous Power with two different electrical loads.
— Electrical load: 100% means that an electrical load of 100% on remaining
DC generator has been included.
— Electrical load: 75% means that an electrical load of 75% on remaining DC
generator has been included.
Note
Care should be taken, when using and interpolating between
the OAT curves, that the correct curves are being used.

Volume AP8.0
QRH GENERAL INFORMATION
CONTENT
The QRH consists of 4 sections which have been grouped into two parts. The
first part combines Limitations, Normal Procedures and Performance Data.
The second part contains Emergency/Malfunction Procedures. The two parts
are mounted back-to-back to allow quick access to either.
The various sections/systems are colour tabbed for ease and quickness of
locating the page required.
A Index of Content is included at the start of each of the two parts.
FLIGHT MANUAL
The QRH does not replace the RFM, however, all information contained in the
QRH is based on the RFM. To operate the aircraft safely and efficiently, the
RFM must be read and thoroughly understood.
If any conflict should exist between this QRH and the Approved RFM the RFM
shall take precedence.
QRH LIMITATIONS
The limitations have been copied from the RFM, however any conflict between
the QRH and Approved RFM Limitations the Limitations in the RFM take
precedence.
QRH NORMAL PROCEDURES
The normal procedures have been copied simplified from the RFM, CAT A
and CAT B procedures have been included.
QRH PERFORMANCE
The performance data includes Hd. Conversion Table and Power Assurance
Charts.
QRH EMERGENCY AND MALFUNCTION PROCEDURE
The procedures have been copied from the RFM and grouped into systems.
The systems are then highlighted with RED tabs for Emergency Procedures,
AMBER tabs for Malfunction Procedures, which have been placed in
alphabetical order.
Additionally a table of Warning and Caution messages and the appropriate
page number for the procedure is included at the start of each section
(Emergency/Malfunction) to aid in rapid location of the correct page.
TEMPORARY REVISIONS
Temporary Revisions are issued when immediate data is to be included in the
manual. The Temporary Revision data can add to or cancel the initial data in
the manual. They are numbered progressively for each section of the manual
and are with red header and footer. Temporary Revision pages are not written
in the ”Record of Effective Pages”. A complete list of active and inactive
Temporary Revisions is written in the ”Record of Temporary Revisions” page.
